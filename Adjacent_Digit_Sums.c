/*
You are given two integers x and y. The variable t in this problem represents the number of test cases.

Each test case is independent and consists of two numbers x and y. For every test case, the program must determine whether there exists an integer n such that:

S(n) = x
S(n+1) = y
where S(a) denotes the sum of the digits of the number a in the decimal numeral system.

The program processes each test case one after another and outputs either "Yes" (if such an n exists) or "No" (if no such n is found).
